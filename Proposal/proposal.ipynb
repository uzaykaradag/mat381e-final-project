    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [dataset](\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pieca111/music-artists-popularity\") contains data about 1.4 million musical artists; their names, some keywords a.k.a. tags and statistics (listener and play count) concerning their popularity (scraped by the creator of the dataset from [last.fm](last.fm)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the dataset to build a model which sufficiently recommends new artists to the user when input 3 artists the user enjoys listening to. The data is well conditioned for this task because the attributes can be used to make relations between discrete artists. When done with the project we would like to present a full-blown applet to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will start off by acquiring the dataset from Kaggle and will clean and correct the necessary parts. After the data goes through the cleaning process we will further perform preprocessing to make it easier to work with in the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then explaratory data analysis will be performed on the data which can be broken into two integral pieces of; visualization and the analysis of the data. This will help us make better decisions while doing feauture engineering and model construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last part, we will do a literature review and general research on the topic of recommender systems and go onto feature engineering for the dataset with the now accumulated knowledge about recommender systems. At last, we will construct the model for music recommendation with respect to all our findings. \n",
